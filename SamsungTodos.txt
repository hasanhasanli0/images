Dear All, good day!
Below you can find the main issues and action plan for both sides discussed at the meeting regarding data discrepancy issues.
 
[SKU level – EDI_PSI report]
Status
Kontakt send to Samsung two types of reports with SKU data:
- [EDI_PSI] – automatic report with SKU-store level sales and stocks data. Send every Sunday with data for the week.
- “KAM files” – several reports with sales and stocks data, which manually send to KAM (example on slide 14)
 
Main issues
1.	Missed Sales and Stock data in EDI_PSI report with recent sell-in (slide 4, more cases in “Kontakt Models to check” file)
2.	Missed Sales and Stock data in EDI_PSI report data for MONITOR (slide 11, issue 2)
3.	Case TOZSORAN SAMSUNG VS15T7031/EV – model mapping issue (slide 5)
4.	Issue with Stores Gence-2 and Lankaran (slide 7) – wrong mapping
5.	Kontakt has 5 warehouses -> decided to continue sending stock data to Anbar Bineqedi (slide 8)
6.	Kontakt provide sales data from Warehouse in EDI file (slide 8)
7.	Issue with returns – discrepancy between EDI file and KAM file in several cases were equal to returns -> already fixed in KAM files (slide 10)
 
[To-do]
Reports update 
1.	Kontakt to create auto report about all Stores/DC and share with Samsung. Samsung to provide desired layout of the report (slide 9)
2.	In order not to lose info about new stores due to lack of mapping in Kontakt, Kontakt will send for new stores in EDI files “store type 2” and their internal code (see  Manual for EDI_PSI report)
3.	Check if it is possible to send [EDI_PSI] report on daily basis with data for the last 7 days
Cases
1.	Kontakt sent a list of all registered in the system models in the format “Partner code – Bom-code – EAN”
2.	After receiving the “Partner code – Bom-code – EAN” mapping, Samsung check it correctness and add missed information 
3.	Kontakt to add Sales and Stock Data for MONITOR product group to [EDI_PSI] Report
4.	VC case TOZSORAN SAMSUNG VS15T7031/EV: Samsung to send @mal to Kontakt to check internally which bom-code is correct and if it’s possible – change internally in Kontakt’s internal system (slide 5)
5.	Samsung to send to Kontakt cases of sales from DC (see excel “Sales from Anbar Bineqedi”), Kontakt to check internally and provide feedback. Comment from the Partner – there can be sales from DC, in this case this is “good in transit” status of goods.
6.	Returns – in KAM files started to count returns (for last 3 weeks). New adjustments, need to check new files, no reason to check old files
7.	Issue with new SKUs late appearance on EDI file – PM+IT in Kontakt will check internally. Samsung to provide examples of such models (slide 4) //EAN kodlar doldurulmalidir
8.	Issue with Stores Gence-2 and Lankaran (slide 7) – Kontakt IT-team to check internally   //OK
 
[Serial numbers]
Status
Kontakt’s PIC manually send SN report in xlsl format to s.bot (daily level, but ~weekly frequency):
- [EDI_SELL_INFO]_1037010_YYYYWW_PRODUCT_GROUP
 
Main issues
1.	By manual SN report information, there are several cases, when SN sale was registered in MCS to one store, but during requested check, SN sale was related to another store (slide 11, issue 1 – see more cases in excel file “SN check may_july” with comment “Указан другой код магазина”)
2.	SN Qty > SKU Qty (slide 12, issue 3, see more cases in excel file “Kontakt SN-SKU comparison”)
a.	Because the format of SN report, returns are not registered in MCS -> second SN sale cannot be registered as well
b.	Unknown reasons (to be checked by the Kontakt side)
3.	SN sales with a time gap between sales date and delivery date may be missed in SN reports provided by Kontakt -> SN sales is not registered to MCS
 
[To-do]
Reports update 
1.	Kontakt develop new format for SN report – instead of “[EDI_SELL_INFO]_1037010_YYYYWW_Product Group” report, Kontakt creates .txt format (manual for SN txt report is attached) -> solve issue with returns
2.	In order to avoid SN loss due to sale-delivery gap, issue will be escalated by Kontakt internally and return feedback
 
•	Suggestions from Samsung side 
Create daily SN report with 2-3 days lag (for example, send SN report at 22.09 for 18.09 sales). To solve issue with missed SN (sale-delivery gap), before closing period (~3-4th working day of the month) send SNs, which were not included in previous reports due to sale-delivery gap.

Cases
1.	S/N issue 1 (slide 11) – Samsung send to Kontakt more cases for internal check (see file “SN check may_july”)
2.	SN Qty > SKU Qty – Kontakt should check why it happens (see file “Kontakt SN-SKU comparison”)
